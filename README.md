# codecademyPythonCodeChallenges1
This repository stores the code to the Python Code Challenges in the "Learn Python 3" Course. I took on this course in order to fill in gaps of knowledge I may have missed from LC as well as to learn things such as OOP and dictionarries proerly. These challenges do not cover these topics but it helps to slowly build up project skills.
